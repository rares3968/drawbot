# drawbot
Before running "DrawBot.py" make sure you have the packages installed!\
Better version of @CowCoding0's draw bot, with some fixes.\
WARNING: This version is not color! Colors were removed because they were just messing up the mouse cursor and they worked only on Gartic Phone.
A drawing bot for any app.\
Simply load in a image and it will do all the work for you as if you would draw it with a mouse.\
